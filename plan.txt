* IMPORTANT: a way to capture the rest of the parameters, like (define (jarl a b . body))

* Once we have the macro system working, there is a BIG cleanup to do:
  - Move as many special forms as possible to the DONUT prelude as macros
  - Move as many operations as possible from the body of the compiler to the JAVASCRIPT compiler
  - Look for a better way to automatically load the JAVASCRIPT AND DONUT preludes everywhere
