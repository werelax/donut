* 1. Decent reader
1b. Decent AST
2. Symbol/var assignment
3. Macro system

== Notes

- implement [] and {} as reader macros for (vec a b c) and (hash a b c)

- Data types:
  ! List -> Bad Idea! Difficult to fly close to JS with Lists
  + Vector
  + Hash/Object
  * String
  * Number
  * Symbol
  *? Keyword
  (so more or less just js data types)

== Decent reader:

* Programable? => Just transformations + recursive call to read
* delimiter: SPAC
* Should be an FSM?

== The LIST problem

* Using a non-js-native structure as the LIST is getting on the way of a clean, thin syntax wrapper over vainilla js.
* A lot of extrange cases are arising when the translation DONUT->JS is not so clear
* So I'm sending lists to hell and using arrays instead. DONUT LIST = JS array. And fuck it.
* Also, the syntax tree will be just nested arrays.
